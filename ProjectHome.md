The fundamental intent of this project is to provide an easily accessible repository of code that is mentioned or made available from my blog, Arbitrary Blog Execution.  I cannot guarantee a rigid structure for organization of projects and ideas, but I believe that my blog can supplant organization with purpose-driven context.

By definition as a repository, expect to find a variety of code, snippets, and downloads spanning the reach of: platforms, frameworks, structures, libraries, extensions, modules, plug-ins, examples and templates.

Thank you for visiting!
